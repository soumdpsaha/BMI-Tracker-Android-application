# BMI-Tracker-Android-application

**BMI and Weight Tracking Android App**  
*Personal Project | Java, SQLite, Android SDK, XML UI Design*

- Developed a full-featured Android application to **track users' BMI and weight history**, supporting user-specific data input, update, and visualization.
- Implemented **SQLite databases** to manage persistent user data and time-stamped weight records using custom helper classes (`DatabaseHelper`, `WeightHistoryDatabaseHelper`).
- Built multiple Android activities (`UpdateData`, `ViewData`, `WeightRecords`, `WeightHistory`) to enable **modular navigation**, data viewing, and updates through `Intent` communication.
- Designed intuitive UI using **XML and Material Design principles**, integrating edge-to-edge layouts and responsive views for a smooth user experience.
- Created a **dynamic ListView adapter** to display historical weight logs retrieved from the database, enhancing user engagement and usability.
- Integrated **real-time weight record updates** with a timestamp feature, enabling chronological weight tracking and potential for data visualization extensions (e.g., bar charts).
- Applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Java for clean code structure, modularity, and maintainability.
- Enabled **seamless navigation and session flow** with logout and home redirects, supporting user experience continuity across sessions.
- Prioritized **data accuracy and persistence**, with proper database lifecycle management (`onCreate`, `onUpgrade`) to ensure reliability across app updates.
- Set up groundwork for **future feature expansion**, such as chart integration with MPAndroidChart and advanced analytics.
